# Overview

This file provides a [sample of the code](code/model.R) used in Wang et al. [submitted to Nature Communications]. This code is intended for transparency and reproducibility and is not able to run.

This project uses dataset that involves 9997 schoolchildren undergoing 24371 visits between 2013 and 2015, among 46 cities, from 28 provinces, municipalities, or municipal districts across all 7 geographical divisions in China.

This project also include processed [data](data/DATA1.csv) for the related variables of interest used in the models for the primary analysis.

Please contact Tiantian Li (litiantian@nieh.chinacdc.cn) with any questions about this code.
